2.  **Initial Org-AI-R Assessment:** Once a company is selected, the application will present an initial assessment framework for its Org-AI-R across several key dimensions. These dimensions typically include aspects like Data Maturity, Technology Infrastructure, AI Talent & Culture, Strategic Alignment, and Process Integration.

    For each dimension, you will likely see input fields (e.g., sliders, dropdowns) to provide a high-level rating or assessment score based on your current understanding of the company. This initial assessment is designed to give you a quick snapshot and identify potential areas of strength and weakness.

    <aside class="positive">
    <b>Tip:</b> This initial assessment is a rapid screening. Think broadly about the company's current state in each dimension. Later steps will allow for a more detailed analysis.
    </aside>

    After inputting your initial scores, the application may display a summary or radar chart visualizing the company's Org-AI-R profile. This visual representation helps to quickly grasp the company's current standing relative to an ideal AI-ready state.

## Step 3: Deep Dive: Dimension-Level Assessment & Gap Analysis
Duration: 00:07:00

Now that we have a high-level understanding, it's time to perform a more detailed, dimension-level assessment. This step allows for a granular evaluation, helping to pinpoint specific strengths, weaknesses, and, most importantly, the gaps that need to be addressed to enhance the company's AI readiness.

1.  **Navigate to the "Deep Dive" Page:** If you are not already on this page, use the sidebar navigation to select "Step 2: Deep Dive: Dimension-Level Assessment & Gap Analysis".

2.  **Detailed Dimension Assessment:** On this page, each Org-AI-R dimension (e.g., Data, Technology, Talent, Strategy, Culture) will be broken down into more specific sub-components or criteria. For instance, the "Data Maturity" dimension might delve into data governance, data quality, data availability, and data privacy.

    You will be prompted to assess the company against these more detailed criteria, often using sliders, numerical inputs, or qualitative descriptions. This deeper assessment allows for a more nuanced understanding of the company's capabilities.

3.  **Gap Analysis:** Based on your detailed inputs, the application will perform a gap analysis. This analysis compares the company's current state to a desired or optimal state for AI readiness. The gaps identified are crucial because they highlight areas where strategic investment and effort are required to improve AI adoption and impact.

    <aside class="negative">

    You might be able to select from a predefined list of common AI applications or input custom ideas.

3.  **Estimate Financial Impact and Feasibility:** For each chosen use case, you will estimate its potential financial impact. This typically involves inputting parameters such as:
    *   **Revenue Uplift:** The increase in revenue the AI solution could generate (e.g., via increased sales, new products).
    *   **Cost Savings:** The reduction in operational costs (e.g., via automation, efficiency gains).
    *   **Implementation Cost:** The estimated investment required to develop and deploy the AI solution.
    *   **Timeframe:** The expected duration for development and realization of benefits.

    The application will then calculate preliminary metrics such as potential **Net Present Value (NPV)** or **Return on Investment (ROI)** for each use case, helping you prioritize based on expected value and feasibility.

    $$ NPV = \sum_{t=0}^{T} \frac{C_t}{(1+r)^t} $$

    Where $C_t$ is the net cash flow at time $t$, $r$ is the discount rate, and $T$ is the total number of periods.

    <aside class="positive">
    Focus on use cases that directly address the gaps identified in the previous step and align with the company's strategic objectives. Prioritize those with the highest potential impact and reasonable feasibility.
    </aside>

4.  **Prioritization:** Based on the estimated impact, you will prioritize a selection of AI use cases to move forward into the multi-year plan.

## Step 5: Build the Multi-Year AI Value Creation Plan

    *   **Total Investment:** Cumulative AI-related expenditures.
    *   **Total Value Created:** Cumulative financial benefits (revenue uplift + cost savings).
    *   **Projected ROI / NPV:** Overall return and net present value of the entire AI portfolio for the company.
    *   **Impact on EBITDA:** How the AI initiatives are projected to boost the company's Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization. This is a critical metric for PE firms.

    <aside class="console">
    Example of projected impact table:
    Year | Investment | Benefits | Net Cash Flow | Cumulative NPV
    --||-||-
    2024 | $X         | $Y       | $Z            | $A
    2025 | $X'        | $Y'      | $Z'           | $A'
